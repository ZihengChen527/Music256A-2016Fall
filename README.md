Waveform Player

Waveform Player is a digital music instrument enabling you to create interesting music pieces using 3 basic waveforms (square, triangle, sawtooth). These three basic waveforms are generated by additive syntheis. You can control frequency, gain and partial number of each waveform independently. 

You can hear how each waveform is generated by gradually adding sinusoid partials to it. You can also compose chords using these three waveforms. By modifying the frequencies, gains and partial numbers of each waveform and playing them together, you can generate lots of interesting sounds and sequences.
